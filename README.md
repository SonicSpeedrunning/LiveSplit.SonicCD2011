# General behaviour

Supports both the Steam version of Sonic CD (2011) and the recent decompilation (available at https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-CD-11-Decompilation).

Timer is grabbed by the game's memory, with the option to switch to RTA-TB (Time Bonus) if needed, eg during All Time Stones speedruns.

Splits upon loading a new stage according to the order required for a normal run - Present/Past/Future acts are all supported.

Splits can be configured in settings

Timer automatically starts when confirming the character selection at the start of a run.
